# AudioNet
AudioNet is a collection of wav format audiosamples acquired from processing creative commons audio features freesound.org.

## Description
AudioNet aims to be a high quality training set for audio event detection. As of now the dataset is still under review, meaning misclassified audio files are still present. Files are arranged in folder main format, although plans to migrate to a WordNet style formatting is anticipated.

To help arrange and review each datalabel I have included a simple PyGame Python script which plays and prompts the validity of each audio sample. Ideally this could be run from a Jupyter Notebook for ease of navigation. To utilize SoundReview from Jupyter, navigate to the audio directory and initialise Run for each file in the current folder 

### Requirements:
* jupyter
* ipython3
